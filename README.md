# Chicago 311 Service Requests Data Pipeline
## Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline around the Chicago 311 Service Requests dataset published by the City of Chicago through the Chicago Data Portal. The dataset contains millions of service request records. The objective of this project is to implement a scalable, cloud-based analytics pipeline that supports incremental ingestion, structured transformation, and business-ready reporting. Overall, the project demonstrates applied knowledge of ETL design, data warehousing principles, incremental data processing, and cloud-native engineering workflows in a real municipal data context.
